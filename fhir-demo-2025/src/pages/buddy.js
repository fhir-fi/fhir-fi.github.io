        <h2>FHIR Appointment Demo</h2>
        <p>
          In the demo video, you will see how appointment information can be managed both by
          healthcare professionals and patients through the Buddy Healthcare platform. It
          enables smooth scheduling of various procedure and outpatient appointments.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating an Appointment: First Example - Chat Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Patient Information</strong><br/>
            Enter the patient's ID and the organizational unit ID i.e., where the service is
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defining the Appointment</strong><br/>
            Specify the reservation type (e.g., chat appointment).<br />
            Select the resource, i.e., the professional who will handle the appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating the Appointment</strong><br/>
            Create the appointment data in the system.<br />
            Once saved, the information is automatically transferred to:
            <ul>
              <li>Buddy Healthcare's platform's professional interface</li>
              <li>To the Buddy Healtcare's patient app</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tasks</strong><br/>
            Tasks for the healthcare professionals and for the patient in care pathway are
            automatically aligned with the appointment time.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Creating an Appointment: Second Example - Surgery Time</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a surgery appointment for the patient</li>
          <li>Select the resources and date and time for the surger</li>
          <li>
            The appointment information immediately appears in:
            <ul>
              <li>Buddy Healthcare's platform's professional interface</li>
              <li>In the patient app</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The care pathway adapts automatically to the new appointment â€” for example,
            instructions for fasting and medication pauses are updated accordingly.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Modifying and Deleting Appointments</h3>
        <p>If an appointment is deleted, the system notifies the professional that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Appointment data is missing</li>
          <li>A message is sent to the patient indicating the appointment is under review</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All changes are visible in real-time to both the professional and the patient, and
          patient guidance can be triggered automatically based on the reason for the change. As
          you noticed, previous time was wrong, changing it to correct one, shows it immediately to
          patient also.
