        <h2>FHIR Appointment Indication and Demo Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          In our FHIR demo, we showcase how professionals can manage patient appointments through
          our system. The system supports smooth scheduling of various procedure and outpatient
          appointments.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating an Appointment: First Example - Chat Appointment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Patient Information</strong><br/>
            Enter the patient's ID and the organizational unit ID where the service is provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defining the Appointment</strong><br/>
            Specify the reservation type (e.g., chat appointment).<br />
            Select the resource, i.e., the professional who will handle the appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating the Appointment</strong><br/>
            Create the appointment data in the system.<br />
            Once saved, the information is automatically transferred to:
            <ul>
              <li>Our system's professional interface</li>
              <li>The patient's app, where it becomes visible</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tasks</strong><br/>
            Tasks in care pathways (e.g., video consultations) are automatically aligned with the
            correct time based on the appointment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Second Example - Surgery Time</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new appointment for the patient, such as a surgery time.</li>
          <li>
            Select the resources and schedule the time a few days after the chat appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The appointment immediately appears in:
            <ul>
              <li>Our professional interface</li>
              <li>The patient's app</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The care pathway adapts automatically to the new appointmentâ€”for example, instructions
            for fasting and medication pauses are updated accordingly.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Modifying and Deleting Appointments</h3>
        <p>If an appointment is deleted, the system notifies the professional that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Appointment data is missing</li>
          <li>A message is sent to the patient indicating the appointment is under review</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All changes are visible in real-time to both the professional and the patient, and
          patient guidance can be triggered automatically based on the reason for the change. As
          you noticed, previous time was wrong, changing it to correct one, shows it immediately to
          patient also.
