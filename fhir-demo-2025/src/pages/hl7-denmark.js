        <h2>FHIR Implementation Guide</h2>
        <p>
          HL7 Denmark has published a FHIR implementation guide (IG) containing the Danish core
          profiles, called DkCore. The most recent IG was published in the beginning of May 2024,
          and can be found on <a href="www.hl7.dk">www.hl7.dk</a>, along with the previous ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          DkCore includes a number of profiles, such a DkCorePatient, DkCoreCondition and more.
          Further, is guidance provided on usage of identifiers, CodeSystem, ValueSets and
          NamingSystems in a Danish context along with necessary extensions for covering local
          concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new version of DkCore is published twice a year. The continuous development follows
          processes for internal quality assurance in the working group and external consultation
          when it is decided by HL7 Denmark. 
        </p>
        <p>
          DkCore is published in version 4 of FHIR - also known as FHIR R4. However, a <a
          href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-core/branches/R5/">CI-build in FHIR R5</a> is
          also maintained, in case project finds it valuable to use DkCore in FHIR R5. Processes
          for development and maintaining to versions can be found on <a
          href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HD/Release+Process+for+DK+Core">Confluence</a>.
