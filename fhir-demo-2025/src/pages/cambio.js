        <h2>HL7 FHIR</h2>
        <p>
          Cambio has been active in the collaborative effort to create the FHIR base profiles for
          Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have several integrations using FHIR, and it is Cambio's default standard for
          integrations and partners. Some examples are integration with ambulance EHRs (<a
          href="https://www.ortivus.com/">Ortivus</a> & <a href="https://omda.com/">Omda</a> are
          the companies) that supports the handover from the ambulance to ED. Another example is
          the company <a
          href="https://www.stretch.se/insights/region-skane-och-bla-appen/">StretchCare</a> (“Blå
          appen” is the app), who use FHIR to support patient questionnaires within children's
          mental health. This removes double documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cambio's strategy is to expose our EHR capabilities via FHIR, for new interfaces it is
          only FHIR (assuming there is a FHIR fit).
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also looking at SMART on FHIR for future application integrations into our EHR
          client.
