          <a href="https://clinibus.com/">Clinibus</a> is a regional eHealth platform, based on
          principles of Finnish National Health Record. <a
          href="https://recibus.com/">Recibus</a> is an electronic prescription system that can be
          deployed as a nationwide turnkey solution. They replicate the advanced national
          architecture in use in Finland, but can be deployed anywhere in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platforms include both the back-end components needed for an organization-wide,
          regional, or national electronic health care or welfare record infrastructure. They also
          include the application programming interfaces and even web-based user interfaces
          required by integrating systems, and users such as doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clinibus and Recibus are based on one of the world's leading national health care
          information architectures - the national Kanta services of Finland. Both products share
          codebase with Atostek's ERA solution, which is used in Finland to connect clinical
          systems to Finnish national health record Kanta, as well as provide direct use of Kanta
          data via ERA's user interfaces. Today, over 40 different systems, 900 healthcare
          organisations, and thousands of users connect to Kanta via ERA service. Over 2,8 million
          citizens' data has been handled with the ERA system.
