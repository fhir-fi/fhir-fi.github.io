        <p>
          Epic is a strong supporter of the HL7® FHIR® standard as the future of REST-based
          interoperability. We support over 500 FHIR APIs across 57 resources in accordance with
          the HL7 FHIR standard. This spans the DSTU2, STU3, and R4 versions of the FHIR
          specification. We continue to regularly grow our number of supported FHIR APIs.
          Organizations can grant access to these resources via the search and read/write RESTful
          APIs that are defined by FHIR.

        <h2>International Patient Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Epic will be among the first organizations to support the International Patient Summary
          (IPS) FHIR specification starting with our May 2025 release. IPS will improve care for
          patients by making it simpler for healthcare organizations to exchange data securely
          across international borders. IPS builds on Epic's existing Care Everywhere and CDA
          workflows to help customers coordinate care with groups that exclusively use FHIR. Learn

          Our SMART on FHIR App Launch Framework provides a contextual and secure way to embed
          third-party applications into your Epic system. The framework supports apps for use by
          clinicians and patients, and uses OAuth 2.0 as a reliable, secure authorization protocol,
          and OpenID Connect for modern, standard authentication.
