# fhir-fi.github.io
The fhir.fi website, live at [fhir.fi](https://fhir.fi).

The website is published through the (GitHub Pages)[https://pages.github.com] functionality.

## FHIR Demo

The [FHIR Demo](https://fhir.fi/demo) section of the site is maintained as a Gatsby app.

The source code of the website for the yearly demo lives at separate branches, one for each year:
* [fhir-demo-2023-gatsby](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2023-gatsby)
* [fhir-demo-2024-gatsby](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2024-gatsby)
* [fhir-demo-2025-gatsby](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2025-gatsby)

This is to keep the source files away from the published pages.

The Readme files in the root directory of the demo source have development instructions:
* [FHIR Demo 2023](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2023-gatsby/fhir-demo-2023)
* [FHIR Demo 2024](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2024-gatsby/fhir-demo-2024)
* [FHIR Demo 2025](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/fhir-demo-2025-gatsby/fhir-demo-2025)

## Finnish Healhth Data Hackathon

The [Nordic Health Data Hackathons](https://fhir.fi/hackathon/) section of the site is maintained
as a Next.js app.

The source code of that section lives at a separate repo, from which only the compiled outputs are
copied to this repo:
* [site source](https://github.com/mrinnetmaki/nordic-health-data-hackathon-series)
* [hackathon](https://github.com/fhir-fi/fhir-fi.github.io/tree/hackathon) branch on this repo
