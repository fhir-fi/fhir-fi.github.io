It also provides the Maisa client portal that offers smoother\n          services for citizens &mdash; the social care and health care services are accessible for\n          them anytime, anywhere.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The enterprise Oy Apotti Ab is owned by the city of Helsinki, the HUS Group, the\n          wellbeing services county of Vantaa and Kerava and the wellbeing services counties of\n          Eastern, Western and Central Uusimaa.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"ecosystem\">\n        <h2>\n          Apotti ecosystem is an environment where our partners can grow and expand internationally\n        </h2>\n        <p>\n          The Apotti ecosystem is a place for experimentation and development.

The most important technical tool for the integration testing of these\n          applications is the Sandbox environment (Apotti Online Sandbox) which is, in essence, the\n          Apotti system without real patient/client data.          \n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Apotti has numerous different technologies available for integrations.

Services can benefit from new data that is produced in real time and\n          utilised in new ways.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If a tool or software developed by a third party works in the Apotti test environment, it\n          is most likely compatible with and functions in the international Epic system which is\n          used in many top-ranking hospitals around the world.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"join\">\n        <h2>Are you interested?</h2>\n        <p>\n          You can join the Apotti ecosystem by contacting us at <a\n          href=\"ekosysteemi@apotti.fi\">ekosysteemi@apotti.fi</a> and setting up a meeting to\n          present your service or application.
